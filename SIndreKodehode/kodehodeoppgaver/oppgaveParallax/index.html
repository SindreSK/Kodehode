        <h2>The Colosseum</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The Colosseum is a nickname given to the stadium long after its use – the first written evidence of the name we have is the Venerable Bede in the 7th Century CE. Originally, it was called the Flavian Amphitheatre because it was built by the Flavian Dynasty (Vespasian, Titus and Domitian). Back in the day most Romans would have just called it the emperors amphitheatre.</p></li>
            <li><p>The Colosseum is oval shaped. It is 189 meters long, 156 meters wide, and 48,5 meters tall. The entire building has a surface area of 6 acres.</p></li>
            <li><p>What is well known is that the colosseum was used for gladiator battles, but what is less known is that they also used it for hunts and executions, And at the beginning they held something called Naumachia, wich was a staged naval battle,for whitch the colosseum was flooded. Naumachia was later moved to an own stadium that was always flooded.</p></li>

        <h2>The political</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Julius Caesar was never an emperor. He was a powerful general who would eventually rule as a dictator (emergency leader in times of war). However, he was perhaps the first Roman to have almost sole control of the Empire. After his death he was deified (made into a god). His name thereafter would become synonymous with the title of Emperor. Later many emperors used Caesar in their titles.</li>
            <li><p>Rome had the first legal system. Known as the Twelve Tables these were first written down in the 5th Century BC. By the 3rd Century BC there were many written laws. The Romans can be called the fathers of bureaucracy as many who live in the modern city of Rome can confirm.</p></li>
            <li><p>Roman slaves were protected by law and could actually buy their freedom. Unlike more recent forms of slavery, Roman slaves were paid a small amount of money given board and lodgings. Over time if they could save enough money, they could buy their freedom. Many slaves were granted freedom by their masters for services well done. Freed slaves often went on to become successful businessmen with the help of their masters</p></li>
            <li><p>The Romans wore Togas to show their status. Togas worn by everyone and they weren’t worn daily. Togas were a status symbol showing your rank in Roman society. If you were senior you could wear a purple stripe on your Toga. The width of the purple strip depended on how important you were. Only the Emperor could wear a purple toga.</p></li>
